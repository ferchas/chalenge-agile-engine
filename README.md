# Requirements 

The goal is to implement a component, which renders text and has several features for text manipulation and formatting.

### ES6 updates

Rewritten from the ground up for ES6 + React with Babel and webpack.

## Getting Started

```
npm install
npm run build
npm run start-dev
```

Now the app should be running at http://localhost:8000/



## Scripts

The `package.json` file comes with the following scripts that you may find useful:

* `npm start` runs a client-only production
* `npm run build` rebuilds the client
* `npm run watch` runs a dev console that reports lint and unit test errors on save

To run a script, open the terminal, navigate to the boilerplate directory, and type:

```
npm run <name of script>
```

### Developer feedback console:

```
npm run watch
```

The dev console does the following:

* Checks for syntax errors with `eslint` using idiomatic settings from `.eslintrc`
* Runs the unit tests and reports any test failures.
* Watches for file changes and re-runs the whole process.
